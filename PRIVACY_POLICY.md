# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy describes how the Contextual Lookup Chrome extension ("the Extension") handles user data.

**Data Collection:**

We want to be clear: **The Contextual Lookup Chrome extension does not collect any personal or usage data from its users.**

This means that we do not track:

* Your browsing history
* The websites you visit
* The text you select or hover over
* Your IP address
* Any other personal information

The Extension operates locally within your Chrome browser. Any processing of text for generating contextual lookups is done directly on your device using either Chrome's built-in AI model or, if you choose to use it, by communicating with third-party AI services (like OpenRouter) via secure API requests initiated by you. We do not intercept or store any of this communication.

**Third-Party Services:**

If you choose to use server-side AI models through services like OpenRouter, please be aware that their own privacy policies will govern how they handle any data you send to them. We encourage you to review their privacy policies. Contextual Lookup itself does not transmit or store your API keys for these services. They are stored locally within your browser's extension settings.

**Permissions:**

The Extension may request certain permissions from your browser to function correctly (e.g., access to the current tab's content to select text). These permissions are necessary for the Extension to provide its features, but they do not grant us access to collect or transmit your personal data.

**Updates to this Privacy Policy:**

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page.

**Contact:**

If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Cay-Zhang/contextual-lookup/issues) on our GitHub repository.
