# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy describes how the Contextual Lookup Chrome extension ("the Extension") handles user data, including the use of Google Analytics.

**Data Collection with Google Analytics:**

The Contextual Lookup Chrome extension uses Google Analytics to collect information about user interactions within the Extension. This helps us understand how the Extension is used, allowing us to improve its functionality and user experience.

**Information Collected by Google Analytics:**

Google Analytics collects data about your activities within the Extension. This may include:

* When you look up a term with Contextual Lookup
* When you initiate or finish the OpenRouter sign-in flow
* Other usage patterns and events within the Extension

This data is collected in an anonymized form and does not include personally identifiable information such as your name, email address.

For more information about how Google Analytics collects and processes data, please refer to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

**Data Usage:**

The data collected through Google Analytics is used to:

* Analyze and improve the Extension's performance and features
* Understand user behavior and preferences
* Track aggregate usage statistics

**Your Choices:**

Google provides users with options to control how their data is collected by Google Analytics. You can learn more about these options and how to opt-out [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

**Third-Party Services:**

If you choose to use server-side AI models through services like OpenRouter, please be aware that their own privacy policies will govern how they handle any data you send to them. We encourage you to review their privacy policies. Contextual Lookup itself does not transmit or store your API keys for these services. They are stored locally within your browser's extension settings.

**Permissions:**

The Extension may request certain permissions from your browser to function correctly. These permissions are necessary for the Extension to provide its features, and they do not grant us access to collect your personal data beyond what is described in this policy concerning Google Analytics.

**Updates to this Privacy Policy:**

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page.

**Contact:**

If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Cay-Zhang/contextual-lookup/issues) on our GitHub repository.
